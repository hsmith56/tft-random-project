# tft-random-project
My attempt at throwing ML onto tft in some way... what could go wrong?


## Things to *eventually* track

  - champions
  - items
  - position on board
  - gold (to facilitate the decisions on champions)

I don't actually care about what position you end in, since 1st-4th will increase your rank, all I want to know is did you go up or down?/
Maybe later the reward can be higher if you get a higher place, would need to be careful though since getting first by 1 hp is not the same as\
getting first by a gap of 30 hp.
